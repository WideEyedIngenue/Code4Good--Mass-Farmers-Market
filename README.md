# Code4Good--Mass-Farmers-Market

This project was created in affiliation with MIT Code4Good, an organization that pairs MIT students with local nonprofits that require their technological skills. Our nonprofit, Mass Farmers Markets, partners with farmers, consumers, and communities to improve the health of individuals, strengthen community vitality, and enhance local farm viability through farmers markets. They required both consulting advice on how to revamp their database and an interactive presentable map that helps consumers search for farmers markets in their area. This GitHub repository contains all the relevant code regarding the interactive map, including instructions on how to update it.
